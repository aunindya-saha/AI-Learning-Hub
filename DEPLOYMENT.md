# Vercel Deployment with Database

## Option 1: Keep localStorage (Current - Simplest)
- ✅ No backend needed
- ✅ Instant deployment 
- ❌ Content doesn't sync across devices
- ❌ Lost if browser data cleared

## Option 2: Add Vercel KV Database
- ✅ Content syncs across all devices
- ✅ Persistent storage
- ✅ Still very simple to implement
- ❌ Requires Vercel account (free tier available)

## Deployment Steps:

### For Option 1 (localStorage):
```bash
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

### For Option 2 (Database):
1. Add Vercel KV to your project
2. I'll create API routes for save/load
3. Replace localStorage with API calls
4. Deploy with database integration

## Which option do you prefer?
